# Students-Cgpa-Prediction
A CGPA Prediction system
This project seeks to create a model that can predict the Cgpa of Students based on some certain features.

Data Mining: The data was collected by sampling 120 students in university of Lagos.
The data was inputed manually into and excel sheet before converting into a csv file.

Pre-processing: There wasn't really much to pre-process with our data.

Feature Engineering: All columns were used except for "names of students". as they all showed reasonable correlation with our output.

Model: Linear Regression was used for modelling as it returned the lowest rmse compared to others algorithms.
